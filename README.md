# three_million_tweets

This is a simple data analysis of a dataset of ~3 million bot tweets provided by FiveThirtyEight. The main gist of this project can be found in the Jupyter Notebook three_million_tweets.ipynb. All information on accessing the dataset and how to run this can be found there.

To run the notebook for yourself, first run the script setup.sh, which will create a python virtual environment and install all necessary modules needed to run the notebook.

If you instead want to use the old scripts rather than the notebook, run them in the following order:
1. data_cleaning.py
2. analyze_tweets.py
3. sentiment_analysis.py
